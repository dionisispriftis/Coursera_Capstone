PROBLEM DESCRIPTION
The problem I chose to implement was to allow a random user to rate already visited places in a predetermined dataset, and using machine learning algorithms recommend to him some other places that might interest him in visiting them.
The recommended places will be extracted by the similarity between the rated by him places, and all the other available options from the dataset.
This idea could be applied in a real world application which suggests places to visit mainly abroad, based on the individual's preferences.
The main steps to achieve the previous idea are the following:
	1. Find or create the appropriate dataset with the desired places
	2. Use the Foursquare API to acquire data for venues around each of our locations
	3. Explore the acquired data and arrange them in a suitable form for further analysis
	4. Rate some of the available neighborhoods 
	5. Create the user's profile, which includes his preferences on each category of the venues
	6. Find neighborhoods he would possibly like, and suggest some of them to him

DATA DESCRIPTION 
Two datasets will be used for the current problem. The first one, I decided to create it on my own and includes the exact locations of several neighborhoods in the city I am living. 
Of course this problem is generalized to be implemented in any city, or multiple cities. The locations have been calculated using data from google maps and have been passed into a Comma - Seperated values (csv) file. 
This csv file includes the neighborhood name, as well as the latitude and longitude of each location. 
The second dataset, is the one acquired for each neighborhood, extracted from the foursquare database, and includes venues around each neighborhood.
